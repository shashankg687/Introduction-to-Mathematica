Dear Dr. Vishal,
On behalf of the QNu Labs and the SparQ Series Organizing Committee, 
we are honored to invite you to speak at the Upcoming events celebrating Quantum Awareness (QA). 
The sessions are scheduled for every alternate Fridays in hybrid mode.

The SparQ Series event is a 1 hour program being curated by Research and Development department of the QNu Labs, 
with an audience of about 100, made up of executives, students, research scholars. 
Our goal is to build awareness of the broad array of challenges, 
opportunities in quantum cryptography with sole motive of igniting a SparQ to take QC. 
Your discussion on the session will be a great addition to our event.

We believe your voice would be a critical addition to the SparQ Series stage. 
Please let us know the date you would be interested in speaking for the session and we will organise it accordingly. 
Thank you in advance for your consideration, and we very much look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Shashank
